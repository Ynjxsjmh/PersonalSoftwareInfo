## About
Git is so convenient for version management that I put my personal settings and collections on it for better management.

The `bookmarks` is my personal bookmark, and the rar file needs a password. 
However, I collected some bookmarks which are placed into folder bookmarksCollected. This means they can be downloaded if you like.

The other file is a record in case that my computer is crashed some day.

Some softwares listed in the software.png are actually not in my computer. They are just a folder which is banned to read and write.

As for Adblock Plus, I recommend this filter rules : <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xinggsf/Adblock-Plus-Rule/master/ABP-FX.txt>.

## Folder structure
Folder `bookmarksCollected` places some bookmarks I collected from somewhere I don't remeber.
Folder `website` stores some websites sharing some interesting things. They all are so long that I couldn't read through them in a time, so I downloaded the whole page for furture reading.
Folder `notes` has something interesting I collected and summerized.
