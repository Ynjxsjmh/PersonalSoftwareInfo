Git is so convenient for version management that I put my personal settings and collections on it for better management.

The `bookmarks` is my personal bookmark, and the rar file needs a password. 
However, I collected some bookmarks which are placed into folder bookmarksCollected. This means they can be downloaded if you like.

The other file is a record in case that my computer is crashed some day.

Some softwares listed in the software.png are actually not in my computer. They are just a folder which is banned to read and write.

As for Adblock Plus, I recommend this filter rules : <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xinggsf/Adblock-Plus-Rule/master/ABP-FX.txt>.
